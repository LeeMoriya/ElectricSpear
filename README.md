# Electric Spear
This is an updated version of Shiro_PB's original Electric Spear mod that works with BepInEx.

Electric Spears are a new type of weapon that can hold three 'charges'. Hitting a creature with the spear will deal increased damage, expending one 'charge'. When all charges are lost, it becomes as effective as a regular spear. However you can 'recharge' the spear by impaling Centipedes.
The spears are highly coveted by the Scavengers and can be found in their hidden treasuries.

The spear is also unlocked by default in Sandbox mode.

## Requirements
EnumExtender is required

This mod also supports AutoUpdate
